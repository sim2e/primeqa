      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Abstract\n",
      "Taejo of Joseon, personal name Yi Seong-gye, later Yi Dan, was the founder and first ruler of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. After overthrowing the Goryeo dynasty, he ascended to the throne in 1392 and abdicated six years later during a strife between his sons. He was honored as Emperor Go following the establishment of the Korean Empire.\n",
      "Taejo emphasized continuity over change. No new institutions were created and no massive purges occurred during his reign. His new dynasty was largely dominated by the same ruling families and officials that had served the previous regime. He re-established amicable ties with Japan and improved relations with Ming China.\n",
      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Biography\n",
      "Early life\n",
      "Taejo's father was Yi Ja-chun, an official of Korean ethnicity serving the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. His mother, Lady Choe, came from a prominent family originally from Deungju; her father, another Yuan official of Korean ethnicity, rose to the position of commander of a mingghan. For quite some time, Lady Choe had been rumored to be of Chinese ethnicity, but due to a lack of evidence and other historical documents that contradict this claim, Lady Choe and her family are recognized by modern historians as ethnic Koreans who served the Yuan dynasty after the Mongol invasions.\n",
      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Historical context\n",
      "By the late 14th century, the 400-year-old Goryeo dynasty established by Wang Geon in 918 was tottering, its foundations collapsing from years of war and de facto occupation by the disintegrating Mongol Empire. The legitimacy of the royal family itself was also becoming an increasingly disputed issue within the court, as the ruling house not only failed to govern the kingdom effectively, but was also affected by rivalry among its various branches and by generations of forced intermarriage with members of the Yuan imperial family, while King U's biological mother being a known slave led to rumors contesting his descent from King Gongmin.\n",
      "Influential aristocrats, generals, and ministers struggled for royal favor and vied for domination of the court, resulting in deep divisions between various factions. With the ever-increasing number of raids against Goryeo conducted by Japanese pirates and the Red Turbans, those who came to dominate the royal court were the reformed-minded Sinjin faction of the scholar-officials and the opposing Gwonmun faction of the old aristocratic families, as well as generals who could actually fight off the foreign threats—namely Yi Seong-gye and his rival Choe Yeong. As the Ming dynasty started to emerge, the Yuan forces became more vulnerable, and Goryeo regained its full independence by the mid-1350s, although Yuan remnants effectively occupied northeastern territories with large garrisons of troops.\n",
      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Military career\n",
      "Yi Seong-gye started his career as a military officer in 1360, and would eventually rise up the ranks. In October 1361, he killed Park Ui, who rebelled against the government. In the same year, when the Red Turbans had invaded and seized Gaegyeong, he helped recapture the capital city with 3,000 men. In 1362, General Naghachu invaded Goryeo and Yi Seong-gye defeated him after being appointed as commander.General Yi had gained prestige during the late 1370s and early 1380s by pushing Mongol remains off the peninsula and also by repelling the well-organized Japanese pirates in a series of successful engagements. Following in the wake of the rise of the Ming dynasty under Zhu Yuanzhang, the royal court in Goryeo split into two competing factions: the camp led by General Yi and the one led by General Choe.\n",
      "When a Ming messenger came to Goryeo in 1388 to demand the return of a significant portion of Goryeo's northern territory, General Choe Yeong seized the opportunity and played upon the prevailing anti-Ming atmosphere to argue for the invasion of the Liaodong Peninsula.A staunchly opposed Yi Seong-gye was chosen to lead the invasion; however, at Wihwa Island on the Amrok River, he made a momentous decision known as the Wihwado Retreat, which would alter the course of Korean history. Aware of the support he enjoyed from both high-ranking officials and the general populace, he decided to revolt and return back to Gaegyeong to secure control of the government.\n",
      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Revolt\n",
      "General Yi swept his army from the Amrok River straight into the capital, defeated forces loyal to the king, and forcibly dethroned King U in a de facto coup d'état, but did not ascend to the throne himself. Instead, he placed on the throne King U's eight-year-old son, Wang Chang, and following a failed restoration attempt of the former monarch, had both of them put to death. Yi Seong-gye, now the undisputed power behind the throne, soon forcibly had a distant royal relative named Wang Yo crowned as the new ruler. After indirectly enforcing his grasp on the royal court through the puppet king, he proceeded to ally himself with Sinjin scholar-officials such as Jeong Do-jeon and Jo Jun.\n",
      "One of the most widely known events that occurred during this period was in 1392, when one of Yi Seong-gye's sons, Yi Bang-won, organized a banquet for the renowned scholar and statesman Jeong Mong-ju, who refused to be won over by General Yi despite their assorted correspondence in the form of archaic poems, and continued to be a faithful advocate for the old regime. Jeong Mong-ju was revered throughout Goryeo, even by Yi Bang-won himself, but in the eyes of the supporters of the new dynasty he was seen as an obstacle which had to be removed. After the banquet, he was killed by five men on the Seonjuk Bridge. This bridge has now become a national monument in North Korea, and a brown spot on one of the stones is said to be one of Jeong Mong-ju's bloodstains that turns red when it rains.\n",
      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Reign\n",
      "In 1392, Yi Seong-gye forced King Gongyang to abdicate, exiled him to Wonju, and crowned himself as the new ruler, thus ending Goryeo's 475 years of rule. In 1393, he changed his dynasty's name to Joseon.Among his early achievements was the improvement of relations with the Ming; this had its origin in Taejo's refusal to attack their neighbor in response to raids from Chinese bandits. Shortly after his accession, he sent envoys to inform the court at Nanjing that a dynastic change had taken place. Envoys were also dispatched to Japan, seeking the re-establishment of amicable connections. The mission was successful, and Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was reported to have been favorably impressed by this embassy. Envoys from the Ryūkyū Kingdom were received in 1392, 1394 and 1397, as well as from Siam in 1393.In 1394, the new capital was established at Hanseong.When the new dynasty was officially promulgated, the issue of which son would be the heir to the throne was brought up. Although Yi Bang-won, Taejo's fifth son by his first wife Queen Sinui, had contributed the most to his father's rise to power, he harbored a profound hatred against two of Taejo's key allies, Jeong Do-jeon and Nam Eun.\n",
      "Both sides were fully aware of the mutual animosity and felt constantly threatened. When it became clear that Yi Bang-won was the most worthy successor, Jeong Do-jeon used his influence to convince the king that the wisest choice would be the son that he loved most, not the son that he felt was best for the kingdom.\n",
      "In 1392, the eighth son of King Taejo, Yi Bang-seok, was appointed as crown prince. After the sudden death of the queen in 1396 and while Taejo was still in mourning for his wife, Jeong Do-jeon began conspiring to pre-emptively kill Yi Bang-won and his brothers to secure his position in the royal court.In 1398, upon hearing of this plan, Yi Bang-won immediately revolted and raided the palace, killing Jeong Do-jeon, his followers, and the two sons of the late Queen Sindeok. This incident became known as the 'First Strife of Princes'. Aghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the throne and psychologically exhausted by the death of his second wife, Taejo immediately named his second son, Yi Bang-gwa, as the new successor and abdicated.\n",
      "Thereafter, Taejo retired to the Hamhung Royal Villa and maintained distance with his fifth son for the rest of his life. Allegedly, Yi Bang-won sent emissaries numerous times, and each time the former king executed them to express his firm decision not to meet his son again. This historical anecdote gave birth to the term Hamhung Chasa, which means a person who never comes back despite several nudges. However, recent studies have found that Taejo did not actually execute any of the emissaries; these people died during revolts which coincidentally occurred in the region.In 1400, King Jeongjong pronounced his younger brother Yi Bang-won as heir presumptive and voluntarily abdicated. That same year, Yi Bang-won assumed the throne of Joseon at last; he is posthumously known as King Taejong.\n",
      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Death\n",
      "King Taejo died ten years after his abdication, on 27 June 1408, in Changdeok Palace. He was buried at Geonwonneung, Dongguneung Cluster, in present-day Guri, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. The tomb of his umbilical cord is located in Geumsan County, South Chungcheong Province, also in South Korea.\n",

      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Ancestry\n",
      "One of the many issues demonstrating the early strained relationship between Joseon and Ming was the debate of Taejo's genealogy, which began as early as 1394 and became a sort of diplomatic friction that lasted over 200 years. The Collected Regulations of the Great Ming erroneously recorded 'Yi Dan' as the son of Yi In-im, and that Yi Dan killed the last four kings of Goryeo, thereby establishing Ming's opinion of Taejo as an usurper first and foremost, from the time of the Hongwu Emperor when he repeatedly refused to acknowledge him as the new sovereign of the Korean Peninsula. The first mention of this error was in 1518, and those who saw the publication made petitions towards Ming demanding for redress, among others left chanseong Yi Gye-maeng and minister of rites Nam Gon, who wrote Jonggye Byeonmu. It took until 1584, through chief scholar Hwang Jeong-uk, that the issue was finally addressed. The Wanli Emperor commissioned a second edition in 1576. About a year after its completion, Yu Hong saw the revision, and returned to Joseon with the good news.\n",
      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Legacy\n",
      "Although Taejo overthrew Goryeo and expelled officials who remained loyal to the previous dynasty, many regard him as a revolutionary and a decisive ruler who eliminated an inept, obsolete and crippled governing system to save the nation from foreign forces and conflicts.\n",
      "The resulting safeguarding of domestic security led the Koreans to rebuild and further discover their culture. In the midst of the rival Yuan and Ming dynasties, Joseon encouraged the development of national identity which was once threatened by the Mongols. However, some scholars, particularly in North Korea, view Taejo as a mere traitor to the old regime and bourgeois apostate, while paralleling him to General Choe Yeong, a military elite who conservatively served Goryeo to death.\n",
      "His diplomatic successes in securing Korea in the early modern period are notable.\n",

      " # Jeongjong_of_Joseon - Biography\n",
      "Born in 1357 as the second son of Yi Seong-gye and his first wife Lady Han, he was a prudent, generous, brave, and able military officer. During the latter days of the declining Goryeo dynasty, Jeongjong followed his father to various battlefronts and fought at his side. When his father took the throne in 1392, he became a prince.\n",
      "Taejo had two wives — the first one, who gave birth to six sons, died before he was crowned; the second wife was Lady Gang, with whom he had two sons. The king favored his youngest son, whose mother was Lady Gang. Chief State Councillor Jeong Do-jeon also backed him as successor, causing much resentment in the other princes.\n",
      "In 1398, Taejo's fifth son, Yi Bang-won led a coup along with many military officers and killed his two younger half-brothers, Jeong Do-jeon, and many of his faction. Yi Bang-won first tried to show that he was not interested in the throne, so he gave a push to Yi Bang-gwa, to be the next crown prince. King Taejo was upset and abdicated in disgust, and Yi Bang-gwa became Joseon's second ruler. The same year he moved the government back to Gaegyeong, the old Goryeo capital.\n",
      "In 1400, a conflict broke out between Yi Bang-won and his elder brother, Yi Bang-gan. Yi Bang-won's force attacked and defeated that of his Yi Bang-gan's, who was then sent into exile along with his family. General Park Bo, who persuaded Yi Bang-gan into rebellion, was executed. King Jeongjong, knowing that he was a mere political figurehead for his younger brother, appointed him as crown prince and abdicated months later.\n",
      "He was an able and wise administrator despite his short reign being marked by bloodshed within the royal family.\n",

      "Taejong of Joseon, personal name Yi Bang-won, was the third ruler of the Joseon dynasty of Korea and the father of Sejong the Great. He was the fifth son of King Taejo, the founder of the dynasty. Before ascending to the throne, he was known as Prince Jeongan.\n",
      " # Taejong_of_Joseon - Biography\n",
      "Early life and founding of Joseon\n",
      "Born in 1367 as the fifth son of Yi Seong-gye and his first wife Lady Han, Yi Bang-won qualified as an official in 1382. He studied under Confucian scholars such as Won Cheon-seok. During his early years, he assisted his father in gathering the support of the commoners and of many influential figures in the government; Yi Bang-won also helped in the founding of Joseon by assassinating powerful officials who remained loyal to Goryeo, most prominently Jeong Mong-ju.\n",
      " # Taejong_of_Joseon - Strifes of Princes\n",
      "After contributing heavily to the overthrowing of the previous dynasty and the establishment of Joseon, he expected to be appointed as successor to the throne. However, his father and Chief State Councillor Jeong Do-jeon favored Taejo's eighth son and Yi Bang-won's youngest half-brother, Yi Bang-seok. This conflict arose chiefly because Jeong Do-jeon, as the principal architect of the ideological, institutional and legal foundations of the new dynasty, saw Joseon as a kingdom led by its ministers by virtue of the king's appointment. In contrast, Yi Bang-won sought direct rule through an absolute monarchy. These differences ultimately contributed to an environment of deep political tension.\n",
      "In 1398, following the sudden death of Queen Sindeok, Yi Bang-won led a coup d'état while King Taejo was still in mourning for his second wife. This event led to the deaths of Jeong Do-jeon and his supporters, as well as the deaths of the late Queen Sindeok's two sons, including the crown prince. The incident became known as the 'First Strife of Princes'. Aghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the crown, and psychologically exhausted by the death of his second wife, Taejo abdicated; his eldest surviving son, Yi Bang-gwa, immediately became the new ruler.\n",
      "Yi Bang-won quickly emerged as the real force behind the throne and was soon in conflict with his disgruntled elder brother, Yi Bang-gan, who also yearned for power. In 1400, General Park Bo, who found the rewards for his deeds during the First Strife of Princes lacking, allied with Yi Bang-gan and rebelled in what came to be known as the 'Second Strife of Princes'. Yi Bang-won successfully defeated his brother's forces, then executed Park Bo and sent Yi Bang-gan into exile. King Jeongjong, now fearful of his formidable younger brother, named Yi Bang-won his successor and abdicated in the same year. At long last, Yi Bang-won, assumed the throne of Joseon and became the dynasty's third monarch.\n",
      " # Taejong_of_Joseon - Reign\n",
      "Consolidation of royal power\n",
      "One of Taejong's first acts as king was to abolish the privilege to maintain private armies which was enjoyed by the aristocracy and the upper echelons of the government. His revoking of the right to keep independent forces effectively severed the upper class' ability to muster large-scale revolts, and drastically increased the number of soldiers employed by the national army.\n",
      "Taejong's next act was to revise the existing legislation concerning land taxation. With the discovery of previously hidden land, national wealth increased twofold.In addition, Taejong created a strong central government. In 1400, before taking the throne, he had played a key role in eradicating the Dopyeong Assembly, a branch of the old administration that had monopolized the executive power during the waning years of Goryeo, in favor of the Privy Council; during Taejong's reign, the Privy Council was replaced by the State Council. Taejong also issued a decree according to which all decisions passed by the State Council could only come into effect with the approval of the king. This ended the custom of court ministers making decisions through debate and negotiations among themselves, and thus brought the royal authority to new heights.\n",
      "Shortly thereafter, Taejong installed a new department known as the Sinmun Office, to hear cases in which aggrieved subjects felt that they had been exploited or treated unjustly by officials or aristocrats. He also placed a big drum in front of the palace, so the common people could beat it to request an audience with the king when they experienced important problems.\n",
      " # Taejong_of_Joseon - Reforms and policies\n",
      "Depite being the one responsible for Jeong Mong-ju's assassination, Taejong posthumously honored him as Chief State Councillor, leading to a great irony — Jeong Do-jeon, whose policies governed Joseon for five centuries, was vilified throughout the dynasty, while Jeong Mong-ju was revered in spite of his opposition to its founding.Taejong promoted Confucianism as the state ideology, thus demoting Buddhism, which consequently never recovered the glory and great power it had enjoyed during the Goryeo period. He closed many Buddhist temples; their vast possessions were seized and added to the national treasury.\n",
      "In foreign policy, he was a straight hardliner — he attacked the Jurchens at the northern border and the Japanese pirates on the southern coast. Taejong is also remembered for being the initiator behind the Ōei Invasion of Tsushima Island in 1419.\n",
      "He set up the system of hopae, an early form of identification which consisted of tags recording the bearer's name and residence; those tags were used to control the movements of the population.In 1403, Taejong ordered 100,000 pieces of metal type and two complete fonts. Predating Gutenberg and Laurens Janszoon by several decades, he accomplished the metal movable type.He promoted publications, commerce and education, and also gave full independence to the Uigeumbu.\n",
      " # Taejong_of_Joseon - Later life and death\n",
      "In 1418, Taejong abdicated in favor of his third legitimate son, Yi Do, but continued to rule with an iron fist and decide on important matters.\n",
      "Along the years, as a means to strengthen royal authority and subdue corruption, he executed or exiled some of the supporters who helped him ascend to the throne, and executed the four brothers of his wife Queen Wongyeong, as well as Sejong's father-in-law Shim On and his younger brother Shim Jeong, in order to limit the influence of in-laws and powerful clans.\n",
      "King Taejong died four years after his abdication, on 10 May 1422, in Sugang Palace. He was buried alongside Queen Wongyeong at Heonneung, Heoninneung Cluster, in present-day Seocho District, Seoul, South Korea.\n",
      " # Taejong_of_Joseon - Legacy\n",

      "Sejong of Joseon, personal name Yi Do, commonly known as Sejong the Great, was the fourth ruler of the Joseon dynasty of Korea and the inventor of Hangul, the native alphabet of the Korean language. Today, he is regarded as one of the greatest leaders in Korean history.\n",
      "Initially titled Grand Prince Chungnyeong, he was the third son of King Taejong and Queen Wongyeong. In 1418, Sejong replaced his eldest brother, Yi Je, as crown prince; a few months later, Taejong voluntarily abdicated the throne in his favor. Despite this, Sejong was a mere figurehead, while his father continued to hold the real power and govern the country until his death in 1422.\n",
      "Sejong reinforced Korean Confucian and Neo-Confucian policies, and enacted major legal amendments. He personally created and promulgated the Korean alphabet, encouraged advancements in science and technology, and introduced measures to stimulate economic growth. He dispatched military campaigns to the north and instituted the Samin Jeongchaek to attract new settlers to the region. To the south, he helped subjugate Japanese pirates through the Ōei Invasion.\n",
      "From 1439, he became increasingly ill and his eldest son, Crown Prince Yi Hyang, acted as regent.\n",
      " # Sejong_the_Great - Name\n",
      "Although the appellation \"the Great\" was posthumously given to almost every monarch from the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties, this style is usually associated with Gwanggaeto and Sejong.\n",
      " # Sejong_the_Great - Early life\n",
      "He was born on 10 April 1397, which was later adjusted to 15 May, after Korea's adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1896. This date is his officially recognized birthday, and is celebrated along with National Teachers Day in South Korea.Sejong was the son of King Taejong by his wife, Queen Wongyeong. When he was twelve, he became Grand Prince Chungnyeong. During childhood, he was favored by his father over his two older brothers.\n",
      "As the third son of the king, his ascension to the throne was unique. Taejong's eldest son, Yi Je, was named heir apparent in 1404. However, his free spirited nature as well as his preference for hunting and leisure activities resulted in his removal from the position in June 1418. Though it is said that he abdicated in favor of Sejong, there are no definitive records. Taejong's second son, Grand Prince Hyoryeong, became a Buddhist monk upon the elevation of his younger brother.\n",
      "Following Yi Je's demotion, Taejong moved quickly to secure his third son's place as heir apparent, and the government was purged of officials who disagreed with the change. In September 1418, Taejong abdicated. However, even in retirement he continued to influence government policy. Sejong's surprising political skill and creativity did not become apparent until after his father's death in 1422.\n",
      " # Sejong_the_Great - Governance\n",
      "Religion\n",
      "Sejong reorganized the government by appointing people from different social classes as civil servants. Furthermore, he performed government ceremonies according to Confucianism, and encouraged people to behave according to the teachings of Confucius.He suppressed Buddhism by banning outside monks from entering Hanseong and reduced the seven schools of Buddhism down to two, Seon and Gyo, drastically decreasing the power and wealth of the religious leaders. One of the key factors in this suppression was Sejong's reform of the land system. This policy resulted in temple lands being seized and redistributed for development, with the monks losing large amounts of economic influence. During the Goryeo dynasty, monks wielded a strong influence in politics and the economy. With the dominant powers of Joseon now being devout Confucianists, Buddhism was considered a false philosophy and the monks were viewed as corrupted by power and money. The Seokbosangjeol, a 24-volume Korean-language translation of Chinese Buddhist texts, was commissioned and published in Sejong's reign by his son Grand Prince Suyang, as an act of mourning for Queen Soheon.\n",
      "In 1427, Sejong also gave a decree against the Huihui community that had held special status and stipends since Yuan dynasty's rule over Goryeo. The Huihui were forced to abandon their headgear, to close down their \"ceremonial hall\" and worship like everyone else. No further mention of Muslims exist during the Joseon era.\n",
      " # Sejong_the_Great - Economy\n",
      "In the early years of the Joseon dynasty, the economy was based on a barter system with cloth, grain, and cotton being the most common forms of currency. In 1423, under King Sejong’s administration, the government attempted to develop a national currency modeled off of the Tang dynasty's kaiyuan tongbao. The Joseon tongbo was a bronze coin, backed by a silver standard, with 150 coins being equal to 600 grams of silver. Production of the Joseon Tongbo ceased in 1425 because they were too expensive to make, with the exchange rate falling to less than the intrinsic value of the coin.\n",
      " # Sejong_the_Great - Foreign policy\n",
      "Sejong collaborated closely with China's Ming dynasty. In relations with Jurchen people, he installed ten military garrisons in the northern part of the peninsula.He opened three ports to trade with Japan; however, he also launched expeditions to crush the Japanese pirates in the East China Sea.\n",
      " # Sejong_the_Great - Military\n",
      "King Sejong was an effective military planner. He created various military regulations to strengthen the safety of his kingdom, and supported the advancement of military technology, including cannon development. Different kinds of mortars and fire arrows were tested as well as the use of gunpowder.In June 1419, under the advice and guidance of his father, Sejong embarked upon the Ōei Invasion. The ultimate goal of this military expedition was to remove the nuisance of Japanese pirates who had been operating close to Tsushima Island. During the invasion, 245 Japanese were killed, and another 110 were captured in combat, while 180 Korean soldiers died. More than 150 kidnap victims were also liberated. A truce was made in July 1419 and the Joseon army returned to the Korean Peninsula, but no official documents were signed until 1443. In this agreement, known as the Treaty of Gyehae, the daimyo of Tsushima promised to pay tribute to the king of Joseon, and in return, the Joseon court rewarded the Sō clan with preferential rights regarding trade between the two countries.In 1433, Sejong sent Kim Jong-seo, a prominent general, to the north to destroy the Jurchens. Kim's military campaign captured several fortresses, pushed north, and expanded Korean territory, to the Songhua River. Four forts and six posts were established to safeguard the people from the Jurchens.\n",
      " # Sejong_the_Great - Science, technology, and agriculture\n",
      "In 1420, Sejong's love for science led him to create an institute within Gyeongbok Palace known as the Hall of Worthies. The institute was responsible for conducting scientific research with the purpose of advancing the country's technology. The Hall of Worthies was meant to be a collection of Joseon's best and brightest thinkers, with the government offering grants and scholarships to encourage young scholars to attend.Sejong promoted the sciences. He wanted to help farmers so he decided to compile a farmer's handbook. Published in 1429, the book – Nongsa Jikseol – dealt with planting, harvesting and soil treatment, and contained information about the different farming techniques that were gathered by scientists from different regions of Korea. These techniques were needed in order to maintain the newly adopted methods of intensive and continuous cultivation.One of his close associates was the great inventor Jang Yeong-sil. As a young person, Jang was a naturally creative and smart thinker. Sejong noticed his skill and immediately called him to his court in Hanseong. Upon giving Jang a government position and funding for his inventions, officials protested, believing a person from the lower classes should not rise to power among nobles. Sejong instead believed he merited support because of his ability. Jang Yeong-sil created new significant designs for water clocks, armillary spheres, and sundials.In 1442, Jang Yeong-sil made one of the world's first standardized rain gauges named cheugugi. This model has not survived, with the oldest existing Korean rain gauge being made in 1770, during the reign of King Yeongjo. According to the Daily Records of the Royal Secretariat, Yeongjo wanted to revive the glorious times of Sejong the Great, and started reading chronicles from that era. When he came across the mention of a rain gauge, Yeongjo ordered a reproduction. Since there is a mark of the Qing dynasty ruler Qianlong, dated 1770, this Korean-designed rain gauge is sometimes misunderstood as having been imported from China.\n",
      "In 1434, Jang Yeong-sil, tasked by King Sejong, invented the gabinja, a new type of printing press. This printing press was said to be twice as fast as the previous model and was composed of copper-zinc and lead-tin alloys.\n",
      "Sejong also wanted to reform the Korean calendar system, which was at the time based upon the longitude of the Chinese capital. He had his astronomers create a calendar with the Joseon capital of Hanseong as the primary meridian. This new system allowed Joseon astronomers to accurately predict the timing of solar and lunar eclipses.In the realm of traditional Korean medicine, two important treatises were written during his reign. These were the Hyangyak Jipseongbang and the Euibang Yuchwi, which historian Kim Yong-sik says represents \"the Koreans' efforts to develop their own system of medical knowledge, distinct from that of China\".\n",
      " # Sejong_the_Great - Public welfare\n",
      "In 1426, Sejong enacted a law that granted government slaves women 100 days of maternity leave after childbirth, which, in 1430, was lengthened by one month before childbirth. In 1434, he also granted the husbands 30 days of paternity leave.In order to provide equality and fairness in taxation for the common people, Sejong issued a royal decree to administer a nationwide public opinion poll regarding a new tax system called Gongbeop in 1430. Over the course of five months, the poll surveyed 172,806 people, of which approximately 57% responded with approval for the proposed reform.Joseon's economy depended on the agricultural output of the farmers, so Sejong allowed them to pay more or less tax according to the fluctuations of economic prosperity and hard times. Because of this, farmers could worry less about tax quotas and instead work at maintaining and selling their crops.\n",
      "It is said that once, when the palace had a significant surplus of food, the king distributed it to poor peasants who needed it.\n",
      " # Sejong_the_Great - Literature\n",
      "Sejong composed the famous Yongbieocheonga, Seokbo Sangjeol, Worin Cheongang Jigok, and Dongguk Jeongun.\n",
      " # Sejong_the_Great - Arts\n",
      "One of Sejong’s closest friends and mentors was the 15th century musician Park Yeon. Together they composed over two hundred musical arrangements. Sejong’s independent musical compositions include the Chongdaeop, Potaepyeong, Pongnaeui, and Yominrak. Yominrak continues to be a standard piece played by modern traditional Korean orchestras, while Chongdaeop and Potaepyeong are played during the Jongmyo Jerye.\n",
      "In 1418, during Sejong's reign, scholars developed the Pyeongyeong, a lithophone modeled off of the Chinese Bianqing. The Pyeongyeong is a percussion instrument consisting of two rows of 8 pumice slabs hung on a decorative wooden frame with a 16-tone range and struck with an ox horn mallet. It was manufactured using pumice mined from the Gyeonggi Province and was primarily used for ceremonies.\n",
      " # Sejong_the_Great - Hangul\n",
      "King Sejong profoundly affected Korea's history with the creation and introduction of hangul, the native phonetic writing system for the Korean language. Although it is widely assumed that he ordered the Hall of Worthies to invent the script, contemporary records such as the Veritable Records of King Sejong and Jeong In-ji's preface to the Hunminjeongeum Haerye emphasize that Sejong invented it himself.Before the creation of the new letters, people in the country primarily wrote using Classical Chinese alongside phonetic writing systems based on Chinese script that predated hangul by hundreds of years, including idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. However, due to the fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and the large number of characters that needed to be studied, the lower classes, who often lacked the privilege of education, had much difficulty in learning how to write. To assuage this problem, King Sejong created this unique alphabet to promote literacy among the common people. Each consonant letter is based on a simplified diagram of the patterns made by the human speech organs when producing the sound related to the character, while vowels were formed by combinations of dots and lines representing heaven, earth and humanity. Morphemes are built by writing the characters in syllabic blocks. The blocks of letters are then strung together linearly.\n",
      "Hangul was completed in 1443 and published in 1446 along with a 33-page manual titled Hunminjeongeum, explaining what the letters are as well as the philosophical theories and motives behind them. The manual purported that anyone could learn the alphabet in a matter of days. People previously unfamiliar with it can typically pronounce Korean words accurately after only a few hours of study.\n",
      "King Sejong faced backlash from the noble class as many disapproved of the idea of a common writing system, with some openly opposing its creation. Many within the nobility believed that giving the peasants the ability to read and write would allow them to find and abuse loopholes within the law. Others felt that hangul would threaten their families’ positions in court by creating a larger pool of civil servants. The Joseon elite continued to use the Chinese hanja long after Sejong’s death. Hangul was often treated with contempt by those in power and received criticism in the form of nicknames, including eonmun, amkeul, and ahaekkeul. Despite this, the system gained popularity among women and fiction writers.\n",
      "In 1504, the study and publication of hangul was banned by Yeonsangun. Its spread and preservation can be largely attributed to three main factors: books published for women, its use by Buddhist monks, and the introduction of Christianity in Korea in 1602. Hangul was brought into the mainstream culture in the 16th century, due to a renaissance in literature and poetry. It continued to gain popularity well into the 17th century, and gained wider use after a period of nationalism in the 19th century. In 1849, it was adopted as Korea’s national writing system, and saw its first use in official government documents. After the Treaty of 1910, hangul was outlawed again until the liberation of Korea in 1945.\n",

      "Sejong was blinded by diabetes complications that eventually took his life in 1450. He was buried at Yeongneung, in the same mound as his wife, Queen Soheon, who died four years earlier. The tomb is located in Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea.\n",
      "His successor was his first son, Yi Hyang. Sejong judged that the sickly Munjong was unlikely to live long, and on his deathbed asked the scholars from the Hall of Worthies to look after his young grandson, Danjong. As predicted, Munjong died two years after his ascension, and the political stability enjoyed in the past decades disintegrated when Danjong became the sixth king of Joseon at the age of twelve. Eventually, Sejong's second son, Grand Prince Suyang, usurped the throne in 1455. When six court officials were implicated in a plot to restore his nephew, Sejo abolished the Hall of Worthies and executed Danjong along with several ministers who served during Sejong's reign.\n",

      "Munjong of Joseon, personal name Yi Hyang, was the fifth ruler of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. As the eldest son of King Sejong the Great and Queen Soheon, he succeeded to the throne in 1450.\n",
      " # Munjong_of_Joseon - Biography\n",
      "Yi Hyang was the longest serving heir apparent during the Joseon dynasty, holding the position for a record 29 years.\n",
      "In January 1421, Sejong instructed that his eight-year-old son be educated by scholars from the Hall of Worthies, then in October the same year, he was invested as crown prince and sent to study at the Sungkyunkwan. From 1442 until his own ascension to the throne in 1450, Yi Hyang served as regent and took care of state affairs during the final years of his father's reign, as Sejong developed various illnesses and disorders.Most of his achievements were during his time as crown prince. Although credit is primarily given to Jang Yeong-sil for inventing the water gauge, the Annals of the Joseon dynasty affirm that it was the prince who found measures of water levels in the ground. Yi Hyang also contributed to the development of the Korean vernacular script.\n",
      " # Munjong_of_Joseon - Reign\n",
      "Yi Hyang ascended to the throne as King Munjong in 1450, and his reign marked the beginning of an imbalance of power at the Joseon court. Gim Bi-hwan describes the \"interaction of the royal authority, administrative power, remonstrative power, and the collective authority of scholars outside the office,\" before Munjong as contributing to a situation that allowed the country to function constitutionally. During Munjong's reign, however, the balance collapsed, setting the stage for his brother to lead a coup d'etat in 1452.\n",
      " # Munjong_of_Joseon - Marriage\n",
      "Munjong was first married to Lady Gim of the Andong Gim clan, between 1427 and 1429. She reportedly used witchcraft to gain his love. She also burned the shoes of Munjong's concubine, and made her drink the ashes with alcohol. When her father-in-law, King Sejong, found out about these actions, he deposed her.\n",
      "The same year his first wife was ousted, Munjong remarried to Lady Bong of the Haeum Bong clan. She was deposed in 1436, when it was discovered that she had a homosexual love affair with one of her palace maids named So-ssang.\n",
      "Lastly, in 1437, Lady Gwon of the Andong Gwon clan became the third wife of Munjong, while he was still the crown prince. Originally a concubine, she gave birth to two daughters, one of whom was Princess Gyeonghye, and to Yi Hong-wi, Mujong's only surviving son, who later became King Danjong. Lady Gwon died in 1441, soon after the birth of her son, and when her husband took the throne, she was posthumously honored as \"Queen Hyeondeok\".\n",

After overthrowing the Goryeo dynasty, he ascended to the throne in 1392 and abdicated six years later during a strife between his sons. He was honored as Emperor Go following the establishment of the Korean Empire.\n",
      "Taejo emphasized continuity over change. No new institutions were created and no massive purges occurred during his reign. His new dynasty was largely dominated by the same ruling families and officials that had served the previous regime. He re-established amicable ties with Japan and improved relations with Ming China.\n",

      "Taejo's father was Yi Ja-chun, an official of Korean ethnicity serving the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. His mother, Lady Choe, came from a prominent family originally from Deungju; her father, another Yuan official of Korean ethnicity, rose to the position of commander of a mingghan. For quite some time, Lady Choe had been rumored to be of Chinese ethnicity, but due to a lack of evidence and other historical documents that contradict this claim, Lady Choe and her family are recognized by modern historians as ethnic Koreans who served the Yuan dynasty after the Mongol invasions.\n",
      "Input language en\n",
      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Historical context\n",
      "By the late 14th century, the 400-year-old Goryeo dynasty established by Wang Geon in 918 was tottering, its foundations collapsing from years of war and de facto occupation by the disintegrating Mongol Empire. The legitimacy of the royal family itself was also becoming an increasingly disputed issue within the court, as the ruling house not only failed to govern the kingdom effectively, but was also affected by rivalry among its various branches and by generations of forced intermarriage with members of the Yuan imperial family, while King U's biological mother being a known slave led to rumors contesting his descent from King Gongmin.\n",
      "Influential aristocrats, generals, and ministers struggled for royal favor and vied for domination of the court, resulting in deep divisions between various factions. With the ever-increasing number of raids against Goryeo conducted by Japanese pirates and the Red Turbans, those who came to dominate the royal court were the reformed-minded Sinjin faction of the scholar-officials and the opposing Gwonmun faction of the old aristocratic families, as well as generals who could actually fight off the foreign threats—namely Yi Seong-gye and his rival Choe Yeong. As the Ming dynasty started to emerge, the Yuan forces became more vulnerable, and Goryeo regained its full independence by the mid-1350s, although Yuan remnants effectively occupied northeastern territories with large garrisons of troops.\n",
      "Input language en\n",
      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Military career\n",
      "Yi Seong-gye started his career as a military officer in 1360, and would eventually rise up the ranks. In October 1361, he killed Park Ui, who rebelled against the government. In the same year, when the Red Turbans had invaded and seized Gaegyeong, he helped recapture the capital city with 3,000 men. In 1362, General Naghachu invaded Goryeo and Yi Seong-gye defeated him after being appointed as commander.General Yi had gained prestige during the late 1370s and early 1380s by pushing Mongol remains off the peninsula and also by repelling the well-organized Japanese pirates in a series of successful engagements. Following in the wake of the rise of the Ming dynasty under Zhu Yuanzhang, the royal court in Goryeo split into two competing factions: the camp led by General Yi and the one led by General Choe.\n",
      "When a Ming messenger came to Goryeo in 1388 to demand the return of a significant portion of Goryeo's northern territory, General Choe Yeong seized the opportunity and played upon the prevailing anti-Ming atmosphere to argue for the invasion of the Liaodong Peninsula.A staunchly opposed Yi Seong-gye was chosen to lead the invasion; however, at Wihwa Island on the Amrok River, he made a momentous decision known as the Wihwado Retreat, which would alter the course of Korean history. Aware of the support he enjoyed from both high-ranking officials and the general populace, he decided to revolt and return back to Gaegyeong to secure control of the government.\n",
      "Input language en\n",
      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Revolt\n",
      "General Yi swept his army from the Amrok River straight into the capital, defeated forces loyal to the king, and forcibly dethroned King U in a de facto coup d'état, but did not ascend to the throne himself. Instead, he placed on the throne King U's eight-year-old son, Wang Chang, and following a failed restoration attempt of the former monarch, had both of them put to death. Yi Seong-gye, now the undisputed power behind the throne, soon forcibly had a distant royal relative named Wang Yo crowned as the new ruler. After indirectly enforcing his grasp on the royal court through the puppet king, he proceeded to ally himself with Sinjin scholar-officials such as Jeong Do-jeon and Jo Jun.\n",
      "One of the most widely known events that occurred during this period was in 1392, when one of Yi Seong-gye's sons, Yi Bang-won, organized a banquet for the renowned scholar and statesman Jeong Mong-ju, who refused to be won over by General Yi despite their assorted correspondence in the form of archaic poems, and continued to be a faithful advocate for the old regime. Jeong Mong-ju was revered throughout Goryeo, even by Yi Bang-won himself, but in the eyes of the supporters of the new dynasty he was seen as an obstacle which had to be removed. After the banquet, he was killed by five men on the Seonjuk Bridge. This bridge has now become a national monument in North Korea, and a brown spot on one of the stones is said to be one of Jeong Mong-ju's bloodstains that turns red when it rains.\n",

      " # Taejo_of_Joseon - Reign\n",
      "In 1392, Yi Seong-gye forced King Gongyang to abdicate, exiled him to Wonju, and crowned himself as the new ruler, thus ending Goryeo's 475 years of rule. In 1393, he changed his dynasty's name to Joseon.Among his early achievements was the improvement of relations with the Ming; this had its origin in Taejo's refusal to attack their neighbor in response to raids from Chinese bandits. Shortly after his accession, he sent envoys to inform the court at Nanjing that a dynastic change had taken place. Envoys were also dispatched to Japan, seeking the re-establishment of amicable connections. The mission was successful, and Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was reported to have been favorably impressed by this embassy. Envoys from the Ryūkyū Kingdom were received in 1392, 1394 and 1397, as well as from Siam in 1393.In 1394, the new capital was established at Hanseong.When the new dynasty was officially promulgated, the issue of which son would be the heir to the throne was brought up. Although Yi Bang-won, Taejo's fifth son by his first wife Queen Sinui, had contributed the most to his father's rise to power, he harbored a profound hatred against two of Taejo's key allies, Jeong Do-jeon and Nam Eun.\n",
      "Both sides were fully aware of the mutual animosity and felt constantly threatened. When it became clear that Yi Bang-won was the most worthy successor, Jeong Do-jeon used his influence to convince the king that the wisest choice would be the son that he loved most, not the son that he felt was best for the kingdom.\n",
      "In 1392, the eighth son of King Taejo, Yi Bang-seok, was appointed as crown prince. After the sudden death of the queen in 1396 and while Taejo was still in mourning for his wife, Jeong Do-jeon began conspiring to pre-emptively kill Yi Bang-won and his brothers to secure his position in the royal court.In 1398, upon hearing of this plan, Yi Bang-won immediately revolted and raided the palace, killing Jeong Do-jeon, his followers, and the two sons of the late Queen Sindeok. This incident became known as the 'First Strife of Princes'. Aghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the throne and psychologically exhausted by the death of his second wife, Taejo immediately named his second son, Yi Bang-gwa, as the new successor and abdicated.\n",
      "Thereafter, Taejo retired to the Hamhung Royal Villa and maintained distance with his fifth son for the rest of his life. Allegedly, Yi Bang-won sent emissaries numerous times, and each time the former king executed them to express his firm decision not to meet his son again. This historical anecdote gave birth to the term Hamhung Chasa, which means a person who never comes back despite several nudges. However, recent studies have found that Taejo did not actually execute any of the emissaries; these people died during revolts which coincidentally occurred in the region.In 1400, King Jeongjong pronounced his younger brother Yi Bang-won as heir presumptive and voluntarily abdicated. That same year, Yi Bang-won assumed the throne of Joseon at last; he is posthumously known as King Taejong.\n",

      "One of the many issues demonstrating the early strained relationship between Joseon and Ming was the debate of Taejo's genealogy, which began as early as 1394 and became a sort of diplomatic friction that lasted over 200 years. The Collected Regulations of the Great Ming erroneously recorded 'Yi Dan' as the son of Yi In-im, and that Yi Dan killed the last four kings of Goryeo, thereby establishing Ming's opinion of Taejo as an usurper first and foremost, from the time of the Hongwu Emperor when he repeatedly refused to acknowledge him as the new sovereign of the Korean Peninsula. The first mention of this error was in 1518, and those who saw the publication made petitions towards Ming demanding for redress, among others left chanseong Yi Gye-maeng and minister of rites Nam Gon, who wrote Jonggye Byeonmu. It took until 1584, through chief scholar Hwang Jeong-uk, that the issue was finally addressed. The Wanli Emperor commissioned a second edition in 1576. About a year after its completion, Yu Hong saw the revision, and returned to Joseon with the good news.\n",

      "Although Taejo overthrew Goryeo and expelled officials who remained loyal to the previous dynasty, many regard him as a revolutionary and a decisive ruler who eliminated an inept, obsolete and crippled governing system to save the nation from foreign forces and conflicts.\n",
      "The resulting safeguarding of domestic security led the Koreans to rebuild and further discover their culture. In the midst of the rival Yuan and Ming dynasties, Joseon encouraged the development of national identity which was once threatened by the Mongols. However, some scholars, particularly in North Korea, view Taejo as a mere traitor to the old regime and bourgeois apostate, while paralleling him to General Choe Yeong, a military elite who conservatively served Goryeo to death.\n",

      "Born in 1357 as the second son of Yi Seong-gye and his first wife Lady Han, he was a prudent, generous, brave, and able military officer. During the latter days of the declining Goryeo dynasty, Jeongjong followed his father to various battlefronts and fought at his side. When his father took the throne in 1392, he became a prince.\n",
      "Taejo had two wives — the first one, who gave birth to six sons, died before he was crowned; the second wife was Lady Gang, with whom he had two sons. The king favored his youngest son, whose mother was Lady Gang. Chief State Councillor Jeong Do-jeon also backed him as successor, causing much resentment in the other princes.\n",
      "In 1398, Taejo's fifth son, Yi Bang-won led a coup along with many military officers and killed his two younger half-brothers, Jeong Do-jeon, and many of his faction. Yi Bang-won first tried to show that he was not interested in the throne, so he gave a push to Yi Bang-gwa, to be the next crown prince. King Taejo was upset and abdicated in disgust, and Yi Bang-gwa became Joseon's second ruler. The same year he moved the government back to Gaegyeong, the old Goryeo capital.\n",
      "In 1400, a conflict broke out between Yi Bang-won and his elder brother, Yi Bang-gan. Yi Bang-won's force attacked and defeated that of his Yi Bang-gan's, who was then sent into exile along with his family. General Park Bo, who persuaded Yi Bang-gan into rebellion, was executed. King Jeongjong, knowing that he was a mere political figurehead for his younger brother, appointed him as crown prince and abdicated months later.\n",

      "After contributing heavily to the overthrowing of the previous dynasty and the establishment of Joseon, he expected to be appointed as successor to the throne. However, his father and Chief State Councillor Jeong Do-jeon favored Taejo's eighth son and Yi Bang-won's youngest half-brother, Yi Bang-seok. This conflict arose chiefly because Jeong Do-jeon, as the principal architect of the ideological, institutional and legal foundations of the new dynasty, saw Joseon as a kingdom led by its ministers by virtue of the king's appointment. In contrast, Yi Bang-won sought direct rule through an absolute monarchy. These differences ultimately contributed to an environment of deep political tension.\n",
      "In 1398, following the sudden death of Queen Sindeok, Yi Bang-won led a coup d'état while King Taejo was still in mourning for his second wife. This event led to the deaths of Jeong Do-jeon and his supporters, as well as the deaths of the late Queen Sindeok's two sons, including the crown prince. The incident became known as the 'First Strife of Princes'. Aghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the crown, and psychologically exhausted by the death of his second wife, Taejo abdicated; his eldest surviving son, Yi Bang-gwa, immediately became the new ruler.\n",
      "Yi Bang-won quickly emerged as the real force behind the throne and was soon in conflict with his disgruntled elder brother, Yi Bang-gan, who also yearned for power. In 1400, General Park Bo, who found the rewards for his deeds during the First Strife of Princes lacking, allied with Yi Bang-gan and rebelled in what came to be known as the 'Second Strife of Princes'. Yi Bang-won successfully defeated his brother's forces, then executed Park Bo and sent Yi Bang-gan into exile. King Jeongjong, now fearful of his formidable younger brother, named Yi Bang-won his successor and abdicated in the same year. At long last, Yi Bang-won, assumed the throne of Joseon and became the dynasty's third monarch.\n",

His revoking of the right to keep independent forces effectively severed the upper class' ability to muster large-scale revolts, and drastically increased the number of soldiers employed by the national army.\n",
      "Taejong's next act was to revise the existing legislation concerning land taxation. With the discovery of previously hidden land, national wealth increased twofold.In addition, Taejong created a strong central government. In 1400, before taking the throne, he had played a key role in eradicating the Dopyeong Assembly, a branch of the old administration that had monopolized the executive power during the waning years of Goryeo, in favor of the Privy Council; during Taejong's reign, the Privy Council was replaced by the State Council. Taejong also issued a decree according to which all decisions passed by the State Council could only come into effect with the approval of the king. This ended the custom of court ministers making decisions through debate and negotiations among themselves, and thus brought the royal authority to new heights.\n",
      "Shortly thereafter, Taejong installed a new department known as the Sinmun Office, to hear cases in which aggrieved subjects felt that they had been exploited or treated unjustly by officials or aristocrats. He also placed a big drum in front of the palace, so the common people could beat it to request an audience with the king when they experienced important problems.\n",

He closed many Buddhist temples; their vast possessions were seized and added to the national treasury.\n",

Furthermore, he performed government ceremonies according to Confucianism, and encouraged people to behave according to the teachings of Confucius.He suppressed Buddhism by banning outside monks from entering Hanseong and reduced the seven schools of Buddhism down to two, Seon and Gyo, drastically decreasing the power and wealth of the religious leaders. One of the key factors in this suppression was Sejong's reform of the land system. This policy resulted in temple lands being seized and redistributed for development, with the monks losing large amounts of economic influence. During the Goryeo dynasty, monks wielded a strong influence in politics and the economy. With the dominant powers of Joseon now being devout Confucianists, Buddhism was considered a false philosophy and the monks were viewed as corrupted by power and money. The Seokbosangjeol, a 24-volume Korean-language translation of Chinese Buddhist texts, was commissioned and published in Sejong's reign by his son Grand Prince Suyang, as an act of mourning for Queen Soheon.\n",
      "In 1427, Sejong also gave a decree against the Huihui community that had held special status and stipends since Yuan dynasty's rule over Goryeo. The Huihui were forced to abandon their headgear, to close down their \"ceremonial hall\" and worship like everyone else. No further mention of Muslims exist during the Joseon era.\n",

      "In the early years of the Joseon dynasty, the economy was based on a barter system with cloth, grain, and cotton being the most common forms of currency. In 1423, under King Sejong’s administration, the government attempted to develop a national currency modeled off of the Tang dynasty's kaiyuan tongbao. The Joseon tongbo was a bronze coin, backed by a silver standard, with 150 coins being equal to 600 grams of silver. Production of the Joseon Tongbo ceased in 1425 because they were too expensive to make, with the exchange rate falling to less than the intrinsic value of the coin.\n",

      "King Sejong was an effective military planner. He created various military regulations to strengthen the safety of his kingdom, and supported the advancement of military technology, including cannon development. Different kinds of mortars and fire arrows were tested as well as the use of gunpowder.In June 1419, under the advice and guidance of his father, Sejong embarked upon the Ōei Invasion. The ultimate goal of this military expedition was to remove the nuisance of Japanese pirates who had been operating close to Tsushima Island. During the invasion, 245 Japanese were killed, and another 110 were captured in combat, while 180 Korean soldiers died. More than 150 kidnap victims were also liberated. A truce was made in July 1419 and the Joseon army returned to the Korean Peninsula, but no official documents were signed until 1443. In this agreement, known as the Treaty of Gyehae, the daimyo of Tsushima promised to pay tribute to the king of Joseon, and in return, the Joseon court rewarded the Sō clan with preferential rights regarding trade between the two countries.In 1433, Sejong sent Kim Jong-seo, a prominent general, to the north to destroy the Jurchens. Kim's military campaign captured several fortresses, pushed north, and expanded Korean territory, to the Songhua River. Four forts and six posts were established to safeguard the people from the Jurchens.\n",

      " # Sejong_the_Great - Science, technology, and agriculture\n",
      "In 1420, Sejong's love for science led him to create an institute within Gyeongbok Palace known as the Hall of Worthies. The institute was responsible for conducting scientific research with the purpose of advancing the country's technology. The Hall of Worthies was meant to be a collection of Joseon's best and brightest thinkers, with the government offering grants and scholarships to encourage young scholars to attend.Sejong promoted the sciences. He wanted to help farmers so he decided to compile a farmer's handbook. Published in 1429, the book – Nongsa Jikseol – dealt with planting, harvesting and soil treatment, and contained information about the different farming techniques that were gathered by scientists from different regions of Korea. These techniques were needed in order to maintain the newly adopted methods of intensive and continuous cultivation.One of his close associates was the great inventor Jang Yeong-sil. As a young person, Jang was a naturally creative and smart thinker. Sejong noticed his skill and immediately called him to his court in Hanseong. Upon giving Jang a government position and funding for his inventions, officials protested, believing a person from the lower classes should not rise to power among nobles. Sejong instead believed he merited support because of his ability. Jang Yeong-sil created new significant designs for water clocks, armillary spheres, and sundials.In 1442, Jang Yeong-sil made one of the world's first standardized rain gauges named cheugugi. This model has not survived, with the oldest existing Korean rain gauge being made in 1770, during the reign of King Yeongjo. According to the Daily Records of the Royal Secretariat, Yeongjo wanted to revive the glorious times of Sejong the Great, and started reading chronicles from that era. When he came across the mention of a rain gauge, Yeongjo ordered a reproduction. Since there is a mark of the Qing dynasty ruler Qianlong, dated 1770, this Korean-designed rain gauge is sometimes misunderstood as having been imported from China.\n",
      "In 1434, Jang Yeong-sil, tasked by King Sejong, invented the gabinja, a new type of printing press. This printing press was said to be twice as fast as the previous model and was composed of copper-zinc and lead-tin alloys.\n",
      "Sejong also wanted to reform the Korean calendar system, which was at the time based upon the longitude of the Chinese capital. He had his astronomers create a calendar with the Joseon capital of Hanseong as the primary meridian. This new system allowed Joseon astronomers to accurately predict the timing of solar and lunar eclipses.In the realm of traditional Korean medicine, two important treatises were written during his reign. These were the Hyangyak Jipseongbang and the Euibang Yuchwi, which historian Kim Yong-sik says represents \"the Koreans' efforts to develop their own system of medical knowledge, distinct from that of China\".\n",

      "In 1426, Sejong enacted a law that granted government slaves women 100 days of maternity leave after childbirth, which, in 1430, was lengthened by one month before childbirth. In 1434, he also granted the husbands 30 days of paternity leave.In order to provide equality and fairness in taxation for the common people, Sejong issued a royal decree to administer a nationwide public opinion poll regarding a new tax system called Gongbeop in 1430. Over the course of five months, the poll surveyed 172,806 people, of which approximately 57% responded with approval for the proposed reform.Joseon's economy depended on the agricultural output of the farmers, so Sejong allowed them to pay more or less tax according to the fluctuations of economic prosperity and hard times. Because of this, farmers could worry less about tax quotas and instead work at maintaining and selling their crops.\n",

Sejong’s independent musical compositions include the Chongdaeop, Potaepyeong, Pongnaeui, and Yominrak. Yominrak continues to be a standard piece played by modern traditional Korean orchestras, while Chongdaeop and Potaepyeong are played during the Jongmyo Jerye.\n",

The Pyeongyeong is a percussion instrument consisting of two rows of 8 pumice slabs hung on a decorative wooden frame with a 16-tone range and struck with an ox horn mallet. It was manufactured using pumice mined from the Gyeonggi Province and was primarily used for ceremonies.\n",

      " # Sejong_the_Great - Hangul\n",
      "King Sejong profoundly affected Korea's history with the creation and introduction of hangul, the native phonetic writing system for the Korean language. Although it is widely assumed that he ordered the Hall of Worthies to invent the script, contemporary records such as the Veritable Records of King Sejong and Jeong In-ji's preface to the Hunminjeongeum Haerye emphasize that Sejong invented it himself.Before the creation of the new letters, people in the country primarily wrote using Classical Chinese alongside phonetic writing systems based on Chinese script that predated hangul by hundreds of years, including idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. However, due to the fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and the large number of characters that needed to be studied, the lower classes, who often lacked the privilege of education, had much difficulty in learning how to write. To assuage this problem, King Sejong created this unique alphabet to promote literacy among the common people. Each consonant letter is based on a simplified diagram of the patterns made by the human speech organs when producing the sound related to the character, while vowels were formed by combinations of dots and lines representing heaven, earth and humanity. Morphemes are built by writing the characters in syllabic blocks. The blocks of letters are then strung together linearly.\n",
      "Hangul was completed in 1443 and published in 1446 along with a 33-page manual titled Hunminjeongeum, explaining what the letters are as well as the philosophical theories and motives behind them. The manual purported that anyone could learn the alphabet in a matter of days. People previously unfamiliar with it can typically pronounce Korean words accurately after only a few hours of study.\n",
      "King Sejong faced backlash from the noble class as many disapproved of the idea of a common writing system, with some openly opposing its creation. Many within the nobility believed that giving the peasants the ability to read and write would allow them to find and abuse loopholes within the law. Others felt that hangul would threaten their families’ positions in court by creating a larger pool of civil servants. The Joseon elite continued to use the Chinese hanja long after Sejong’s death. Hangul was often treated with contempt by those in power and received criticism in the form of nicknames, including eonmun, amkeul, and ahaekkeul. Despite this, the system gained popularity among women and fiction writers.\n",
      "In 1504, the study and publication of hangul was banned by Yeonsangun. Its spread and preservation can be largely attributed to three main factors: books published for women, its use by Buddhist monks, and the introduction of Christianity in Korea in 1602. Hangul was brought into the mainstream culture in the 16th century, due to a renaissance in literature and poetry. It continued to gain popularity well into the 17th century, and gained wider use after a period of nationalism in the 19th century. In 1849, it was adopted as Korea’s national writing system, and saw its first use in official government documents. After the Treaty of 1910, hangul was outlawed again until the liberation of Korea in 1945.\n",

      "His successor was his first son, Yi Hyang. Sejong judged that the sickly Munjong was unlikely to live long, and on his deathbed asked the scholars from the Hall of Worthies to look after his young grandson, Danjong. As predicted, Munjong died two years after his ascension, and the political stability enjoyed in the past decades disintegrated when Danjong became the sixth king of Joseon at the age of twelve. Eventually, Sejong's second son, Grand Prince Suyang, usurped the throne in 1455. When six court officials were implicated in a plot to restore his nephew, Sejo abolished the Hall of Worthies and executed Danjong along with several ministers who served during Sejong's reign.\n",

      "In January 1421, Sejong instructed that his eight-year-old son be educated by scholars from the Hall of Worthies, then in October the same year, he was invested as crown prince and sent to study at the Sungkyunkwan. From 1442 until his own ascension to the throne in 1450, Yi Hyang served as regent and took care of state affairs during the final years of his father's reign, as Sejong developed various illnesses and disorders.Most of his achievements were during his time as crown prince. Although credit is primarily given to Jang Yeong-sil for inventing the water gauge, the Annals of the Joseon dynasty affirm that it was the prince who found measures of water levels in the ground.

Gim Bi-hwan describes the \"interaction of the royal authority, administrative power, remonstrative power, and the collective authority of scholars outside the office,\" before Munjong as contributing to a situation that allowed the country to function constitutionally. During Munjong's reign, however, the balance collapsed, setting the stage for his brother to lead a coup d'etat in 1452.\n",
